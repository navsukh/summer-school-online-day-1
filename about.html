        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p>I’m a final-year B.Tech student in Computer Science and Business Studies at Thapar Institute, with a strong interest in building impactful tech solutions. My journey into tech started with curiosity, and over the years, it has evolved into a passion for creating apps and platforms that solve real-life problems, especially in education, mental health, and student empowerment.

            I specialize in Flutter, Firebase, Node.js, and MongoDB, and enjoy working on both frontend and backend to bring ideas to life.  Beyond coding, I enjoy exploring UI/UX design, collaborating on innovative ideas, and mentoring peers. I believe that technology is not just about code—it's about people, and I strive to build solutions that are user-friendly, inclusive, and scalable.

            Always open to learning, growing, and connecting with like-minded individuals to create something meaningful.</p>
